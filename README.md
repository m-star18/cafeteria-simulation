## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install cafeteria-simulation.

```bash
pip install cafeteria-simulation
```

## Usage

The easiest simulation to perform

```python
from cafe import Cafeteria


TIME = 20
TABLE = 30
NUMBER = [6] * TABLE
SEATS = [[-1] * 6 for _ in range(TABLE)]

cafeteria_data = [TABLE, NUMBER, SEATS]
env = Cafeteria(cafeteria_data, TIME)

for _ in range(TIME):
    env.run([])

# A graph showing the change in scores
env.show()
```

You can specify it by assigning the coordinates [table number, seat number] to run().

Also, you can refer to the number of people in group_member up to 10 groups.
